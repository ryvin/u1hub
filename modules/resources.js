// modules/resources.js — Resource Monitor (v2.16).
//
// Answers one question: "for everything Dispatch has scheduled, how much
// filament of each color do I need, how much is on the shelf, and what do I
// have to buy?"
//
// Design notes, and why it looks like this:
//
//  * Parsing happens HERE, server-side, where the NAS is reachable. The browser
//    never sees a gcode file. Reads are head 64 KB + tail 512 KB — the config
//    block lives at the end of the file and the header block at the start, and
//    a scheduled library is ~220 files of 35-350 MB. Streaming them would be
//    minutes of SMB traffic per page load.
//
//  * The parse cache is keyed on (path, mtime, size), the same shape core uses
//    for PAL_CACHE. A re-slice changes mtime and size, so the key self-
//    invalidates; nothing has to be told to flush.
//
//  * Inventory (remaining / net weight / price / buy link) lives in
//    resources.json, NOT in spools.json. rfid.js owns spools.json and rewrites
//    it on every tag bind; adding columns there would mean two writers on one
//    file. Here the spool record stays the identity, and this file stays the
//    quantity, joined by spool id.
//
//  * PURGE IS NOT ADDED ANYWHERE. Verified 2026-08-31 against real Orca 2.3.5
//    output: an 88-tool-change job reconciles to 0.01 g and a 1002-tool-change
//    job to 0.01 g. Orca charges flush extrusion to the slot doing the purging,
//    so per-slot grams already include it. Adding a purge estimate on top would
//    double-count. parser.js keeps `unaccounted_g` as an integrity check only.

// Nearest-color match ceiling. Above this dE2000 nothing is proposed at all —
// the color lands in Unassigned rather than being silently attached to
// something that is not it. Below REVIEW_DE the match is treated as confident.
//
// These defaults were tuned against the real shelf (11 spools) and the real
// schedule (56 distinct colors) on 2026-08-31. A first pass at dE 25 produced
// confidently wrong rows — slicer blue #0080FF matched "Ash Gray" at 20.7 and
// pink #FF80FF matched "Orchid Rainbow" at 12.0. Neither is the same filament in
// any sense that helps someone shopping. At 10 the survivors are the ones that
// hold up by eye (#37383B -> Bambu Black at 2.8, #C0C0C0 -> Elegoo Clear at 3.1,
// #80FFFF -> Translucent Cyan at 4.7) and everything else goes to Unassigned,

// pair (#F8E1C2 vs #EAC9B0) is 7.3: the two families share lightness and
// yellowness and differ almost entirely on a* (flesh +8 to +11, bone -1 to +3),

// offered instead. Search links need no API key, no approval and no account
// linkage — the tag rides in the query string and a purchase made through it is
// credited. That is the whole feature.
//
// NOT BUILDABLE HERE: "check whether it is available on Amazon and build the
// product link automatically". That needs the Product Advertising API, which
// requires three qualifying sales before it is granted — and Amazon does not
// pay commission on purchases by the account holder, their friends, relatives
// or associates, so the operator cannot bootstrap those sales themselves. A
// search link is therefore labelled as a search, never dressed up as a product
// listing the Hub has verified exists. Claiming otherwise would be the Hub
// inventing a fact, which is the one thing this codebase refuses to do.

  // was loaded in the head that printed it. The pieces were all here already:
  // the file's per-slot grams (slotsFor), the printer's logical->physical head
  // map (fleet mapTable), and the loadout (which spool is in which head). This
  // joins them once, on the print.done edge from core/events.js.
  //
  // Deliberately conservative:
  //   * Only rolls with a recorded remaining_g are touched. A roll nobody ever
  //     weighed does not get an invented number that then goes negative.
  //   * Never below zero. A roll that hits 0 is reported, not hidden.
  //   * Cancelled prints deduct nothing (the file's total is wrong for them and
  //     the Hub does not know how far it got). Paused-then-finished is a finish.
  //   * Every deduction is written to a log the Spools tab can show, with the
  //     before/after, so a wrong one can be undone by hand in ten seconds.
  //   * One switch (settings.auto_deduct) turns it off.
